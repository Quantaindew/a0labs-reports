  - Excellent UI design 
- **Limitations**
  - Limited network support (mainly ETH and Polygon) 
- **Speed**: Good 
- **User Experience**: Polished 

### Orbiter Finance
- **Strengths**
  - Extensive network coverage 
  - Fast transaction speeds 
- **Limitations**
  - Highest gas fees among tested bridges 
- **Speed**: Fast 

### Squid Bridge
- **Strengths**
  - One of the highest transactions by volume in a month among the tested bridges, showing trust and reliability 
  - Feature-rich platform 
  - Engaging design with animations 
- **Limitations**
  - Buggy UI elements 
  - Interface needs refinement 
- **Speed**: Variable 

### Stargate
- **Strengths**
  - Sleek interface 
  - Comprehensive information display for easy swapping and knowing about the status of your transaction 
  - Flexible transaction modes (Fast and Economy) 
- **Notable Feature**: Dual-mode transactions 
  - Economy mode for gas savings 
  - Fast mode for quicker transfers 
  - Can upgrade to fast mode after initial approval if you feel the transaction is moving too slow 
- **Speed**: Variable (user-controlled) 
- **User Experience**: Highly intuitive 

### Defiway
- **Strengths**
  - Clean, functional UI 
  - Good network availability 
  - Refueling capability to ensure gas fee availability 
- **Limitations**
  - No time estimates 
- **Speed**: Above average 

### Special Note on Bridge Security of the above mentioned bridges
- Most non-ZK bridges rely on centralized validators or multisig committees, introducing risks like collusion and single points of failure (e.g., Wormhole’s $325M exploit in 2022). While some use decentralized networks (e.g., Stargate’s LayerZero), their security depends on external assumptions. 

## Special Note on Solana Integration of the most popular bridges above.
Solana bridging remains a work in progress across platforms, with common challenges including:
- Wallet compatibility issues (especially with Solflare)
- Inconsistent user experience
- Limited wallet support majorly solved by using phantom but a bad experience for users of wallets other than solflare.

### A0 Zero Knowledge EVM Bridge (RISC-Z ZK VM)
- **Strengths**
  - **Trustless ZK Proofs**: Uses zero-knowledge proofs on RISC-Z ZK VM for secure, private transfers between EVM chains and AO 
  - **Seamless Interoperability**: Simplifies cross-chain interactions between EVM ecosystems and AO (Arweave’s decentralized compute layer) 
  - **Real-Time Transparency**: Dynamic balance updates before/after transactions 
  - **Optimized Execution**: RISC-V environment ensures efficient contract execution 
  - **User-Centric Design**: Integrated AR Connect Wallet for proof submission; no manual proof management required 
- **Limitations**
  - Proof generation may add marginal latency for complex transactions 
- **Speed**: Fast
- **Security**: Highest (ZK-proof validated)
